# iffco-tokio-performance-dashboard
Excel dashboard for simulated insurance data showing policy performance, claims, and premium KPIs.


📊 **Project Overview**  
This Excel dashboard was built using **simulated insurance data** to analyze and visualize key performance metrics such as:

- Total Premium Collected  
- Pending Claims  
- Premium Trends by Gender, Age Group, and Year  
- Claim Status Breakdown by Policy Type

🧼 **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
- The original dataset contained **missing values (~5% of rows)** in multiple columns such as `Age`, `Gender`, `Premium_Amount`, and `Policy_End_Date`.  
- These missing values were handled using **statistical imputation techniques**, such as:
  - Filling numerical columns with **mean or median**
  - Filling categorical columns using the **mode**
  - Completing missing dates with logical assumptions

🧰 **Tools Used**  
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, KPIs)  
- Simulated dataset (10,000 rows generated using Python Faker library)

🔐 **Disclaimer**  
This project uses **synthetic data** for demonstration purposes only and is not affiliated with IFFCO Tokio General Insurance. It was created solely for learning and showcasing Excel dashboard and analysis skills.
